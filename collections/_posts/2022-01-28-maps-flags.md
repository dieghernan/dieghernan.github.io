On 27 Jan. 2022 my package **rasterpic** was accepted on
[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=rasterpic) (Hooray!!). This package
allows to geotag images, using an spatial object (from **sf** or **terra**) as a
geographic reference.

I tweeted about that, and it seems to have a good feedback from the
[#rspatial](https://twitter.com/hashtag/rspatial) community:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/rspatial?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#rspatial</a> Do we need a package for using our own pictures as base maps? I donâ€™t know, but anyway we have it! {rasterpic} ðŸ“¦ is now on CRAN, and we can convert our pngs to spatial rasters like this <a href="https://t.co/fpoollARoN">https://t.co/fpoollARoN</a> <a href="https://t.co/l9o7rQwdgX">pic.twitter.com/l9o7rQwdgX</a></p>&mdash; dieghernan Ù† (@dhernangomez) <a href="https://twitter.com/dhernangomez/status/1486666356544225281?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 27, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>


I received also an interesting reply to this from **Hefin Ioan Rhys**
[@HRJ21](https://twitter.com/HRJ21):

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Ooh I think a map with countries filled with their own flag would be poppin&#39;.</p>&mdash; Hefin Ioan Rhys (@HRJ21) <a href="https://twitter.com/HRJ21/status/1486976368936116225?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 28, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>


That remembers me to a [previous
post](https://dieghernan.github.io/202002_cartography1/#png-layer) that I wrote
when I added some new functions to the **cartography** package, now replaced by
the [**mapsf**](https://cran.r-project.org/package=mapsf) package.

With rasterpic we have now an alternative tool for creating maps using images,
and this quick post would show you how to do it.

I would replicate the Africa map presented on my previous plot, but this time I
would use newer packages, as
[**giscoR**](https://cran.r-project.org/package=giscoR) package, and the
development version of
[**ggspatial**](https://github.com/paleolimbot/ggspatial/pull/92) (not released
yet), that adds support to `SpatRaster` object on **ggplot2**. The flags would
be extracted from the GitHub repository
<https://github.com/hampusborgos/country-flags>.


```r

# Development version of ggspatial
# devtools::install_github("paleolimbot/ggspatial")
library(ggspatial)
library(ggplot2)
library(giscoR)
library(dplyr)
library(rasterpic)

# For country names
library(countrycode)

world <- gisco_get_countries(epsg = 3857)
africa <- gisco_get_countries(region = "Africa", epsg = 3857)

# Base map of Africa
plot <- ggplot(world) +
  geom_sf(fill = "grey90") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = "lightblue"))

plot +
  # Zoom on Africa
  coord_sf(
    xlim = c(-2000000, 6000000),
    ylim = c(-4000000, 5000000)
  )
```

Now, let's add the flags with a loop:


```r

# We paste the ISO2 code to each african country
africa$iso2 <- countrycode(africa$ISO3_CODE, "iso3c", "iso2c")

# Get flags from repo - low quality to speed up the code
flagrepo <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hjnilsson/country-flags/master/png250px/"

# Loop and add
for (iso in africa$iso2) {
  # Download pic and plot
  imgurl <- paste0(flagrepo, tolower(iso), ".png")
  tmpfile <- tempfile(fileext = ".png")
  download.file(imgurl, tmpfile, quiet = TRUE, mode = "wb")

  # Raster
  x <- africa %>% filter(iso2 == iso)
  x_rast <- rasterpic_img(x, tmpfile, crop = TRUE, mask = TRUE)
  plot <- plot + layer_spatial(x_rast)
}

plot +
  geom_sf(data = africa, fill = NA) +
  # Zoom on Africa
  coord_sf(
    xlim = c(-2000000, 6000000),
    ylim = c(-4000000, 5000000)
  )
```
