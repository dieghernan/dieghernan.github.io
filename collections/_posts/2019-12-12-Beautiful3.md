**Updated 17 february 2020**: All these pieces of work are already
available on `cartography >v.2.4.0` on functions [`hatchedLayer](http://riatelab.github.io/cartography/docs/reference/hatchedLayer.html)
and [`legendHatched`](https://riatelab.github.io/cartography/docs/reference/legendHatched.html). Just install it via `install.packages("cartography")`. A dedicated blog
post with examples on this [link](../202002_cartography1). 
{: .alert .alert-info .p-3 .mx-2 .mb-3 }

On this post I would introduce a couple of functions that may be useful
for improving your maps. The goal is to produce different filling
patterns that could be added over your shapefiles.

At this point, I would like to suggest you (if you haven’t done it yet)
to install the `cartography` package
([vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/cartography/vignettes/cartography.html)),
as it presents a good bunch of interesting features, and fully
compatible with the `sf` environment. In fact, I took some pieces of the
base code in order to develop my own `legendPattern` function.

## Required R packages

``` r
library(sf)
library(dplyr)
library(rnaturalearth)
```

## Grid approach

I already worked with the `st_make_grid` on a previous
[post](https://dieghernan.github.io/201906_Beautiful1/), and this time I
have applied the same approach. Some examples here on how the grid can
be used to create patterns:

### Dots

``` r
DE <- ne_countries(50,
  type = "countries",
  country = "Germany",
  returnclass = "sf"
) %>%
  st_transform(3035)

grid <- st_make_grid(DE,
  what = "corners",
  square = F
)

# To avoid dots close to the edge
# See https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/343222/remove-points-that-are-close-to-a-border-when-building-a-grid

DEDist <- st_union(DE) %>% st_cast("MULTILINESTRING")
d <- as.double(st_distance(grid, DEDist))
# Points no closer than 20kms
grid2 <- grid[d > 20000]

par(mar = c(0, 0, 0, 0))
plot(st_geometry(DE))
plot(st_geometry(grid2), col = "red", add = T)
```

### Grid

``` r
# Grid
grid <- st_make_grid(DE,
  what = "polygons",
  square = T
) %>%
  st_cast("LINESTRING") %>%
  st_intersection(DE)

# Clean and keep lines only
grid2 <- grid[st_geometry_type(grid) %in% c("LINESTRING", "MULTILINESTRING")]

par(mar = c(0, 0, 0, 0))
plot(st_geometry(DE))
plot(st_geometry(grid2), col = "red", add = T)
```

![](../assets/img/blog/20191212_gridex-1.png)<!-- -->

Easy, right? Let’s move to the next level\!

### Horizontal line

``` r
# Horizontal
grid <- st_make_grid(DE,
  what = "polygons",
  square = T
)

par(mar = c(0, 0, 0, 0))
plot(grid)
plot(grid[55], add = T, col = "blue")
plot(
  st_point(st_coordinates(grid[55])[1, 1:2]),
  col = "red",
  add = T,
  pch = 16
)

plot(
  st_point(st_coordinates(grid[55])[2, 1:2]),
  col = "orange",
  add = T,
  pch = 16
)
plot(
  st_point(st_coordinates(grid[55])[3, 1:2]),
  col = "pink",
  add = T,
  pch = 16
)
plot(
  st_point(st_coordinates(grid[55])[4, 1:2]),
  col = "black",
  add = T,
  pch = 16
)
```

As it can be seen, we can extract specific points of each grid. Once
that I identified them it is just a matter of connecting points using
the `st_linestring` function.

``` r
# Select horizontal only
grid_int <- lapply(
  1:length(grid),
  function(j) {
    st_linestring(st_coordinates(grid[j])[c(1, 2), 1:2])
  }
) %>%
  st_sfc(crs = st_crs(DE)) %>%
  st_intersection(DE)

# Clean and keep lines only
grid2 <- grid_int[st_geometry_type(grid_int) %in% c("LINESTRING", "MULTILINESTRING")]

par(mar = c(0, 0, 0, 0))
plot(st_geometry(DE))
plot(st_geometry(grid2), col = "red", add = T)
```

## The `patternLayer` function

I put all that together on a function named `patternLayer`
([link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dieghernan/dieghernan.github.io/master/assets/functions/patternfun.R)).
The main inputs are:

  - `x`: `sf` object. It must be a `POLYGON` or a `MULTIPOLYGON`.
  - `pattern`: fillings available are `c("dot", "text", "diamond",
    "grid", "hexagon", "horizontal", "vertical", "zigzag", "left2right",
    "right2left", "circle")`.
  - `density` of the grid. By default the function uses a grid with a
    minimum of 10 cells on the shortest dimension of the bounding box.
    Additionally it is possible to pass a `cellsize` value that would
    feed the `st_make_grid` underlying function.
  - `txt` for the `text` pattern, that should be a character.
  - Different graphical parameters can be also passed, as `add`, `cex`,
    `lty`, `pch`, etc. Basically three modes are allowed: points, lines
    and texts.

Let’s see how it works.

``` r
# Load function
source("../assets/functions/patternfun.R")


par(
  mfrow = c(3, 4),
  mar = c(1, 1, 1, 1),
  cex = 0.5
)
patternLayer(DE, "dot")
title("dot")
patternLayer(DE, "text", txt = "Y")
title("text")
patternLayer(DE, "diamond", density = 0.5)
title("diamond")
patternLayer(DE, "grid", lwd = 1.5)
title("grid")
patternLayer(DE, "hexagon", col = "blue")
title("hexagon")
patternLayer(DE, "horizontal", lty = 5)
title("horizontal")
patternLayer(DE, "vertical")
title("vertical")
patternLayer(DE, "left2right")
title("left2right")
patternLayer(DE, "right2left")
title("right2left")
patternLayer(DE, "zigzag")
title("zigzag")
patternLayer(DE, "circle")
title("circle")
```

![](../assets/img/blog/20191212_showfun-1.png)<!-- -->

Let’s play a little bit more with some of the additional features of the
function:

``` r
par(mar = c(1, 1, 1, 1), mfrow = c(2, 3))
plot(st_geometry(DE))
patternLayer(
  DE,
  "dot",
  pch = 10,
  density = 0.5,
  cex = 2,
  col = "darkblue",
  add = T
)
plot(st_geometry(DE))
patternLayer(
  DE,
  "dot",
  pch = 21,
  col = "red",
  bg = "green",
  cex = 1.25,
  add = T
)
plot(st_geometry(DE), col = "grey")
patternLayer(
  DE,
  "text",
  txt = "DE",
  density = 1.1,
  col = "white",
  add = T
)
plot(st_geometry(DE), col = "blue")
patternLayer(
  DE,
  "horizontal",
  lty = 3,
  cellsize = 150 * 1000,
  add = T
)
patternLayer(DE, "zigzag", lwd = 2, col = "red")
plot(st_geometry(DE), border = "orange", lwd = 2)
patternLayer(DE,
  "left2right",
  density = 2,
  col = "orange",
  add = T
)
```

## Adding legends: the `legendPattern` function

As a complementary function, I created also the `legendPattern`
function, heavily based on the `legends.R` script developed by
*@riatelab* for the `cartography` package ([source
code](https://github.com/riatelab/cartography/blob/master/R/legends.R)).

Main parameters are:

  - `pos`, `title.txt`, `title.cex`, `values.cex`,`categ`, `cex` and
    `frame`: See `?cartography::legendTypo`.
  - `patterns`: vector of patterns to be created for each element on
    `categ`.
  - `ptrn.bg`: Background of the legend box for each `categ`.
  - `ptrn.text`: Text to be used for each `categ="text"`, as a single
    value or a vector.
  - `dot.cex`: `cex` of each `categ="dot"`, as a single value or a
    vector.
  - `text.cex`: text size of each `categ="text"`, as a single value or a
    vector.
  - As in the case of the `patternLayer`function, different graphical
    parameters can be passed (`lty`, `lwd`, `pch`, `bg` on points).

Note that is also possible to create solid legends, by setting `col` and
`ptrn.bg` to the same color. Parameters would respect the order of the
`categ` variable.

``` r
par(mar = c(0, 0, 0, 0), mfrow = c(1, 1))
plot(st_geometry(DE)) # Null geometry
legendPattern(
  title.txt = "Example 1",
  categ = c("a", "b"),
  patterns = "dot",
  pch = c(16, 23),
  frame = T
)
legendPattern(
  pos = "left",
  title.txt = "Example 2",
  categ = c("c", "d", "other text"),
  patterns = c("text", "zigzag"),
  ptrn.text = c("s", "pp"),
  ptrn.bg = "grey80",
  col = c("red", "blue")
)

legendPattern(
  pos = "topright",
  title.txt = "Example 3",
  categ = c("e", "f", "solid"),
  patterns = c("circle", "left2right"),
  ptrn.bg = c("orange", "yellow", "green"),
  col = c("white", "white", "green"),
  lty = c(2, 4),
  lwd = c(1, 3)
)


legendPattern(
  pos = "bottomright",
  title.txt = "Example 4",
  values.cex = 1.2,
  categ = c("h", "i", "j", "k"),
  patterns = c("grid", "diamond", "horizontal", "dot"),
  cex = 2,
  pch = 22,
  col = "white",
  ptrn.bg = "black",
  bg = "pink"
)
```

I hope that you find this functions useful. Enjoy and nice mapping\!
