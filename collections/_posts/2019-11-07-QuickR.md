How to place an inset map in **R**? There are many solutions out there using the `ggplot2` package (see [Drawing beautiful maps programmatically with **R**, `sf` and `ggplot2`](https://www.r-spatial.org/r/2018/10/25/ggplot2-sf-3.html) by Mel Moreno and Mathieu Basille). However, I like the old reliable `plot` function, so the question is: is there another way?


There is. I found inspiration [here](https://www.statmethods.net/advgraphs/layout.html) and I just applied it to a map.


## Required R packages


```r
library(sf)
library(dplyr)
library(rnaturalearth)
```

## Mimicking Moreno & Basille

I would present here an alternative version of [Drawing beautiful maps programmatically with R, sf and ggplot2](https://www.r-spatial.org/r/2018/10/25/ggplot2-sf-3.html), so the bulk of the detail can be found there. I would focus only in the `plot()`side.


```r
world <- ne_countries(scale = "medium", returnclass = "sf")
USA <- subset(world, admin == "United States of America")

# Plot mainland USA----
par(mar = c(0, 0, 0, 0))
plot(
  st_geometry(world %>%
    st_transform(2163)),
  xlim = c(-2500000, 2500000),
  ylim = c(-2300000, 730000),
  col = "#F6E1B9",
  border = "#646464",
  bg = "#C6ECFF"
)
plot(
  st_geometry(USA) %>% st_transform(2163),
  col = "#FEFEE9",
  border = "black",
  add = T
)
```

```r
# Plot Alaska----
plot(
  st_geometry(world %>%
    st_transform(3467)),
  xlim = c(-2400000, 1600000),
  ylim = c(200000, 2500000),
  col = "#F6E1B9",
  border = "#646464",
  bg = "#C6ECFF"
)
plot(
  st_geometry(USA) %>% st_transform(3467),
  col = "#FEFEE9",
  border = "black",
  add = T
)
```

```r
# Plot Hawaii----
plot(
  st_geometry(world %>%
    st_transform(4135)),
  xlim = c(-161, -154),
  ylim = c(18, 23),
  col = "#F6E1B9",
  border = "#646464",
  bg = "#C6ECFF"
)
plot(
  st_geometry(USA) %>% st_transform(4135),
  col = "#FEFEE9",
  border = "black",
  add = T
)
```

## Insetting

From now on, I just focus on the inset part, using the `fig()` option on `par()`. Quoting [statmethods](https://www.statmethods.net/advgraphs/layout.html):

>*(...) think of the full graph area as going from `(0,0)` in the lower left corner to `(1,1)` in the upper right corner. The format of the `fig=` parameter is a numerical vector of the form `c(x1, x2, y1, y2)`(...)
`fig=` starts a new plot, so to add to an existing plot use `new=TRUE`.*

So being `x1` and `y1` the starting points and `x2`, `y2` the final points, we just can set up those parameters and adjust the final placement of the insets. Additionally I added a box around the insets using `bbox()`. I didn't mimic Moreno & Basille here and I just worked it by myself.


```r
par(mar = c(0, 0, 0, 0))
plot(
  st_geometry(world %>%
    st_transform(2163)),
  xlim = c(-2500000, 2500000),
  ylim = c(-2300000, 730000),
  col = "#F6E1B9",
  border = "#646464",
  bg = "#C6ECFF"
)
plot(
  st_geometry(USA) %>% st_transform(2163),
  col = "#FEFEE9",
  border = "black",
  add = T
)
# Alaska
par(
  fig = c(0.01, 0.28, 0.01, 0.33),
  new = TRUE
)
plot(
  st_geometry(world %>%
    st_transform(3467)),
  xlim = c(-2400000, 1600000),
  ylim = c(200000, 2500000),
  col = "#F6E1B9",
  border = "#646464",
  bg = "#C6ECFF"
)
plot(
  st_geometry(USA) %>% st_transform(3467),
  col = "#FEFEE9",
  border = "black",
  add = T
)
box(which = "figure", lwd = 1)

# Hawaii
par(
  fig = c(0.29, 0.45, 0.01, 0.15),
  new = TRUE
)
plot(
  st_geometry(world %>%
    st_transform(4135)),
  xlim = c(-161, -154),
  ylim = c(18, 23),
  col = "#F6E1B9",
  border = "#646464",
  bg = "#C6ECFF"
)
plot(
  st_geometry(USA) %>% st_transform(4135),
  col = "#FEFEE9",
  border = "black",
  add = T
)

box(which = "figure", lwd = 1)
```

Results may vary depending of the size of the original plot (Mainland USA) and your plotting device and output. However with a bit of trial-and-error it is quite easy to adjust the final result.

As an example, see one of my contributions to **Wikimedia Commons** that represents a map of the NUTS3 regions of the European Union. Several countries (France, Portugal, Spain) have overseas territories so I made a few insets on the right side.
