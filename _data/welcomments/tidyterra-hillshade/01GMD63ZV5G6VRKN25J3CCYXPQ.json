  "message": "Hi Jim, thanks for your comments:\n\n1. The library name is `geodata`, it is on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/geodata/index.html). You should be able to install it with\n2. `install.packages(\"geodata\")`.\n3. The \"mapslib\" folder is a working folder on my computer where I stored data to avoid re-downloading files. You probably don't have it, so you can use a custom folder as (some examples):\n\n```r\nmydir <- \".\" # Data downloaded on your working folder, see getwd()\n```\n\nOr\n\n```r\n# Temporary folder\nmydir <- tempdir() \n\n```\n\nHope this helps.",
