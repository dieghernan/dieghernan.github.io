  "message": "First things first, I had some trying to install `tidygeocoder` from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidygeocoder/index.html). You specified R (≥ 3.20), that forces me to update to R 4.0. Maybe you meant R (≥ 3.2.0)?\n\nThe good news are that I was able to generate the leaflet map, see [live here](https://dieghernan.github.io/blog/testleaflet/) and Rmd/md [on this folder](https://github.com/dieghernan/dieghernan.github.io/tree/master/blog) (testleaflet.Rmd).\n\nBad news is that on my setup it worked smoothly on the first run, so I just rerun your code \"as is\", using the md_document option.\n\nSo I guess it should be related with some of your configuration of R or knitr. Anyway, there is a potential workaround for cases like yours:\n\n1. Create a copy of your *.md and change the output to output: html_document.\n2. Knitr and open the *.html. Find the leaflet map (`<div>` and `<script>`). Those chunks of code are what you need.\n3. Paste that on the *.md file and discard the files generated.\n\nI needed also to update the Leaflet scripts! Now are available [on my repo](https://github.com/dieghernan/dieghernan.github.io/blob/master/_includes/leaflet.html).\n\nHope that helps, regards",
