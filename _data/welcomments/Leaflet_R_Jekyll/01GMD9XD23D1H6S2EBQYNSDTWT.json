I'm using the md_document format and right now I'm getting a screenshot of the leaflet map instead of the HTML content. I did try github_document earlier, but for some reason that causes some image file path issues. Here's my [Rmd file](https://github.com/jessecambon/jessecambon.github.io/blob/leaflet-experiment/_posts/2020-07-15-tidygeocoder-1-0-0.Rmd) and my [md](https://github.com/jessecambon/jessecambon.github.io/blob/leaflet-experiment/_posts/2020-07-15-tidygeocoder-1-0-0.md) file.",
