From the leaflet.html file, I had to remove the flatly.js library because it messed up the code block syntax highlighting and I removed the viewport because it changed the width of the site. I also had an issue with white grid lines showing up on the leaflet tiles, but that was fixed by moving the include statement for leaflet.html down a bit in the head.html file.\n\nThanks for the help!",
